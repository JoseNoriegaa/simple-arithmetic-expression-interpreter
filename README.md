# simple-arithmetic-expression-interpreter
This is a simple arithmetic expression interpreter that I made just for learning a new programming language (Java) and about code interpreters.


## Features
- Arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
- Order of operations.
